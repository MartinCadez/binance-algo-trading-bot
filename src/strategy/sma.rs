/// ================================
/// SMA-based strategy + trade flow
/// ================================
/// This module:
/// 1) computes simple moving averages (SMA),
/// 2) derives a bullish/bearish signal from fast vs slow SMA,
/// 3) decides an action (EnterLong / ExitLong / Hold),
/// 4) executes the action by opening/closing a position in the DB.
///
/// Assumptions:
/// - `is_position_open` / `open_trade` / `close_trade` / `get_open_trade_info`
///   rely on a *position-based* trades schema (`symbol`, `status = 'OPEN'|'CLOSED'`, etc.).
/// - Candlestick timestamps must align with DB expectations (seconds for `to_timestamp()`).

/// Compute the simple moving average of the latest `lookback` candles.
/// Uses the *most recent* candles first (reverse iteration).
///
/// NOTE:
/// - If `lookback == 0`, this will divide by zero (panic).
/// - If `candlesticks.len() < lookback`, it will average fewer values
///   but still divide by `lookback` (biasing the result down). Consider
///   validating inputs before calling in production.
